Salable SDK for JavaScript

The Salable SDK enables you to easily interact with the Salable ecosystem, accessing the Salable API, and other toolkit methods.

## Getting Started

Letâ€™s walk through setting up a project that uses the Salable API Class from the SDK and makes a simple call to retrieve all licenses. The following steps use npm as an example. These steps assume you have Node.js and npm already installed.

1. Create a new Node.js project.
2. Inside of the project, run: `npm install @Salable/node-sdk`. Adding packages results in update in lock file, [yarn.lock](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa/#should-lockfiles-be-committed-to-the-repository) or [package-lock.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/package-lock-json). You **should** commit your lock file along with your code to avoid potential breaking changes.

3. Create a new file called index.js, Instantiate a SalableApi Class and send a request.

```javascript
const { SalableApi } = require("@Salable/node-sdk");
(async () => {
  const api = new SalableApi("API-KEY");
  try {
    const licenses = await api.licenses.getLicenses();
    console.log(licenses);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```
